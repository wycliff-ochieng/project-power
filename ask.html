                <div class="questions">Why does this project exist</div>
                <div class="answer">Django grew from a very practical need: World Online, a newspaper Web operation, is responsible for building
                    intensive Web applications on journalism deadlines.

                <div class="questions">Is django stable</div>
                <div class="answer">Yes, itâ€™s quite stable. Companies like Disqus, Instagram, Pinterest, and Mozilla have been using Django for many
                    years.

                <div class="questions">Does django scale</div>
                <div class="answer">Yes. Compared to development time, hardware is cheap, and so Django is designed to take advantage of as much
                    hardware as you can throw at it.
